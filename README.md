## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

I learnt that you could use the grid layout to get the sections laid out exactly how you want using gridlines.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.card-feature-middle-top {
      /* grid-area: cardone; */
     grid-column: 2/3;
     grid-row: 1/3;
      
    }
```


### Continued development

This was a fun challenege and I will continue to learn more about using grid layout and gridlines. I managed to do a mobile first design then desktop using the media query. 

### Useful resources

- (https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This helped me for reset the css. I really liked this and will use it going forward.
- [Kevin Powell's Responsive 21 day Course](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts) - This is an amazing course which helped me finally understand media query. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
